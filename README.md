# Saraha-console-app

A C++ console app just like saraha site Made with my team in the second year of my college 

can be refectred by making the FILE just as a class of API functions to use in USER class, so instead of getting all data from all files at the beginning of runtime, we can 
just make a method called getDate which user can use to get the data he wants from the file by supplying it by filename, and reference of variables to set data into
